            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Ecologists, biologists and  environmental scientists at Microsoft Research and the United Nations  Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), have  spent 3 years developing the world&rsquo;s first &lsquo;General Ecosystem Model&rsquo;, or GEM, a  model that simulates all life on Earth (land and oceans).  The model is the first to couple all of the  key biological processes that underpin the life cycle and behaviour of all of  the millions of trillions of the planet&rsquo;s organisms – photosynthesis, feeding,  metabolism, reproduction, dispersal, and death – in order to attempt to capture  how such processes lead to the structure and function of whole ecosystems. In  this way, the model addresses the central questions in ecology: how do  interactions among plants and animals lead to the ecosystems that we see around  us, how do these ecosystems vary across the world, what will happen to these  ecosystems in the future in response to various human pressures, and how can we  mitigate or reverse any damage?</p>
            <p>Dubbed the &lsquo;Madingley Model&rsquo;, after  the village in Cambridgeshire, UK, where the scientists first hatched the idea,  the model is now able to reproduce characteristics of the ecosystems that we  see in the real world, from the small-scale (how long do small mammals live?),  to the large (do more productive ecosystems  support more herbivores?). The model also makes new, testable predictions about  how ecological interactions among individual organisms shape the natural world  that surrounds us.</p>
            <p>The Madingley Model could help address  key environmental issues, in particular, the effects of human pressures such as  habitat loss or the introduction of invasive species on the health and  functioning of ecosystems, and the &lsquo;services&rsquo; those ecosystems provide for  humans (for example, stable supplies of clean water, pollination of crops, or  fisheries). The model offers decision-makers a tool to explore the potential  effects of their decisions on the environment, in a computer, before the  decisions are rolled out in the real world. In this light, the Madingley Model  was cited as an exemplary development at the plenary meeting of the  Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) in  2013.</p>
            <p>The model brings together decades  of previous work in theoretical and empirical ecology. The current version is a  first working version which will hopefully encourage other scientists to become  involved in developing this, or analogous, global models of life. We are  releasing the model as open source code, allowing anyone to inspect the current  version of the model or develop it further.<br />
              In some ways, what we have begun to  do is build the equivalent of the climate models that are used to predict the  future of the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and oceans, but for ecosystems. We still have  some way to go before we reach the complexity and sophistication of such  climate models, which have been in development for decades, but we hope that by  engaging the broader ecological community we can make rapid progress.            </p>

            <h2>FAQ's</h2>
            <h3><em>What,  in a nutshell, is &lsquo;The Madingley Model&rsquo;?</em></h3>
            <p>A huge computer simulation of all  life on Earth.</p>
            <h3><em>What  was Microsoft&rsquo;s contribution to the work?</em></h3>
            <p>Microsoft is very much not just  technical / computer support on this project! For 8 years now, Microsoft  Research has had its own group of ecologists, who carry out and lead novel  ecological science such as this. However, like most scientists, the Microsoft  ecologists are highly collaborative, and need to work with other scientists and  in partnership with other organizations.</p>
            <h3><em>Why  is Microsoft interested in ecology?</em></h3>
            <p>The world is facing many pressing  environmental issues. Solving these issues requires new ecology and  environmental science, and this science depends on advances in computational  methods, software, data gathering, modelling and technology in general. As the  world&rsquo;s largest software company, it is natural that Microsoft would be heavily  involved in environmental science.</p>
            <h3><em>What  is UNEP-WCMC?</em></h3>
            <p>The mission of UNEP-WCMC, based in Cambridge, UK, is to  provide the world with the information it needs to assess issues and  biodiversity and conservation worldwide. UNEP-WCMC employs over 100 scientists  who assemble gather data, and other sources of information, into uniquely  valuable products relating to conservation and biodiversity, including but not  limited to land-use change, invasive species, trade in wildlife, carbon,  fisheries, pollution, and agriculture.</p>
            <h3><em>Why  is UNEP-WCMC interested in modelling all life on Earth?</em></h3>
            <p>UNEP-WCMC believes  that the Madingley Model project has the potential to create valuable new  information relating to conservation and biodiversity worldwide. UNEP-WCMC has  been an equal partner with Microsoft Research throughout the project, including  co-funding the project, and providing various expertise.</p>
            <h3><em>What  does &lsquo;open sourcing&rsquo; the model mean?</em></h3>
            <p>Open source is a mechanism for sharing  computer code in way that allows others to inspect, and modify and build upon  that code. </p>
            <h3><em>Why  are you open sourcing the Madingley Model?</em></h3>
            <p>The project aims to create an  asset that is of value globally, to all humankind, and that can be develop and  improved upon by many scientists over coming years and decades. So it is  natural that we should open source it. </p>
            <h3><em>What  have you found so far?</em></h3>
            <p>To date, the main result is that the model, which is  based on individual-scale ecological processes (like finding and eating food,  giving birth to juveniles) reproduces many of the larger-scale patterns that we  can see in ecosystems, such as geographical gradients in animal biomass, or  trophic pyramids. This is an exciting &lsquo;proof of principle&rsquo; that this kind of  modelling is actually possible. However, we have already begun to examine what  happens when you hit the model with simulated human pressures, such as  deforestation and hunting of wildlife.</p>
            <h3><em>What  do other scientists think of the model?</em></h3>
            <p>The reaction to the model has been  largely positive, but the model is somewhat controversial. Many ecologists  consider that nature is simply too complex to model in this way. Others believe  that the outputs from the models are too uncertain to be the basis of important  decisions, such as where to place protected areas or how best to run fisheries.  But the creators of the Madingley Model believe that ecologists must at least  try to model ecosystems, if we are to understand and ultimately save them.</p>
            <h3><em>How  will the model be used?</em></h3>
            <p>There are so many potential uses of the model, that  is impossible to predict which will become most important. Because the model if  a kind of &lsquo;virtual biosphere&rsquo;, then it allows us to simulate almost any  scenario. From predicting the effects of invasive rats on islands; to Amazon  deforestation; to pollution; to overfishing; to climate change; to the removal  of keystone species; to &lsquo;rewilding&rsquo; scenarios that attempt to restore ecosystem  function; the model can be expected to become a key tool that people everywhere  use to guide their decisions on how to interact with the environment. Last, but  not least, the model may be crucial in guiding science, e.g. which processes to  study, in which ecosystems, which data to gather, which experiments to do etc. The model is likely to throw up new scientific questions that were not evident  before it was built.</p>
